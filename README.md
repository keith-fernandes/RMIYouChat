# RMIYouChat
YouChat is based on Remote Method Invocation in Java - and as it is required to create a Chat application system that allows multiple users to connect to a server and through it have a communication with each other.
My choice was to use Java RMI to facilitate remote communication between them once I understood better how the RMI works.
